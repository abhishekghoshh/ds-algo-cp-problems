    *  Recursion with Memoization.
      In the last approach, we can observe that a lot of redundant function calls
      were made with the same value of i as the current index and the same value of
      the sum as the current sum.
      Since the same values could be obtained through multiple paths in the recursion tree.
      To remove this redundancy, we make use of memoization as well to store the results
      which have been calculated earlier.

      Thus, for every call to calculate(nums, i, sum, S), we store the result obtained in memo[i][sum + total],
      where total stands for the sum of all the elements from the input array.
      The factor of total has been added as an offset to the sum value
      to map all the sum possible to positive integer range.
      By making use of memoization, we can get the result of each redundant function call in constant time.

      Time complexity: O(t *n)).
      The memo array of size O(t*n) has been filled just once.
      Here, tt refers to the sum of the nums array and nn refers to the length of the nums array.
      Space complexity: O(t*n).
      The depth of the recursion tree can go up to n. The memo array contains t*n elements.

      0 <= nums[i] <= 1000 criteria is in the input
      if all num is less than zero then we can just use Math.abs(sum)
      we will add sum as offset
      as at some point there be a situation where the current sum can be less than
      zero, so to tackle that we will increase the array size by sum,
      so if all the elements will be minus then also the current sum will get 0

    /*
    *  Brute force approach
     The brute force approach is based on recursion.
     We need to try to put both the + and - symbols at every location in the given nums array
     and find out the assignments which lead to the required result
     For this, we make use of a recursive function calculate(nums, i, sum, S),
     which returns the assignments leading to the sum SS, starting from the ith
     index onwards, provided the sum of elements up to the ith element is sum.
     This function appends a + sign and a - sign both to the element at the
     current index and calls itself with the updated sum as sum +
     nums[i]sum+nums[i] and sum - nums[i]sumâˆ’nums[i] respectively along with the
     updated current index as i+1.
     Whenever we reach the end of the array, we compare the sum obtained with SS.
     If they are equal, we increment the count value to be returned.
     Time complexity: O(2^n) as Size of recursion tree will be 2^n
     Space complexity: O(n) The depth of the recursion tree can go up to n.
