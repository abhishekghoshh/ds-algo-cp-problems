		// The minimum Spanning tree is a tree representation of a graph where we have n nodes and n-1 edges.
		// Which means the minimum number of edges to connect all the nodes in a graph.
		// Minimum spanning tree will also have the fewest distance edges for connecting all the nodes.
		// A graph can have multiple spanning trees

		// There are a couple of algorithms for transforming a graph to the minimum spanning tree
		// 1.Prim's Algorithm
		// 2.Kruskal Algorithm
