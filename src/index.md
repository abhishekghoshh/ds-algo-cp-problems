## Introduction

**Operations Per Second**: Most competitive programming platforms allow approximately 10^8 operations per second. Some may allow 10^7 operations. Generally, if your algorithm's complexity results in operations exceeding 2^27 (which is approximately 134,217,728),
it is likely to cause TLE in a 1-second time frame.

### Time Complexity Estimates:

- **O(1)** : Acceptable for tiny inputs.
- **O(logN)** : Acceptable for inputs up to 10^9
- **O(N)** : Acceptable for N up to 10^8
- **O(NlogN)** : Acceptable for N up to 10^5
- **O(N^2)** : Acceptable for N up to 10^4
- **O(N^3)** : Acceptable for N up to 10^2
- **O(2^N) and O(N!)** : This is considered a relatively small value, and algorithms with a time complexity of O(2^N)
  where (n â‰¤ 10) are often accepted.Generally not acceptable for any significant input size due to their rapid growth.
